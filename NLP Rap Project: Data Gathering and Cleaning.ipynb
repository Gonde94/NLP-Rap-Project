Move from the gate now, [Chorus: Method Man], Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M., get the money, Dollar dollar bill, y'all, Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M., get the money, Dollar dollar bill, y'all, [Verse 2: Inspectah Deck], It's been twenty-two long, hard years, I'm still strugglin', Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival, I peep at the shape of the streets, And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep, A man with a dream with plans to make cream, Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen, A young buck sellin' drugs and such, who never had much, Tryin' to get a clutch at what I could not—, The court played me short, now I face incarceration, Pacin', goin' upstate's my destination, Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us, Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough, But as the world turned, I learned life is hell, Livin' in the world no different from a cell, Every day I escape from Jakes givin' chase, Sellin' base,,  , smokin' bones in the staircase, Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess, I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed, But I'm still depressed, and I ask: what's it worth?, Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth, Who explained workin' hard may help you maintain, To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain, We got stick-up kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks, And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot, Leave it up to me while I be livin' proof, To kick the truth to the young black youth, But shorty's runnin' wild, smokin' sess, drinkin' beer, And ain't tryna hear what I'm kickin' in his ear, Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted, That what? That life is hectic, [Chorus: Method Man & , Inspectah Deck, ], Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M., get the money, Dollar dollar bill, y'all, Cash rules everything around me,  (, My niggas gots to do what they gotta do, ), C.R.E.A.M., get the money, Dollar dollar bill, y'all,  (, To get through, know what I'm sayin'?, ), Cash rules everything around me,  (, Because you can't just get by no more, ), C.R.E.A.M., get the money, Dollar dollar bill, y'all,  (, Word up, you gotta get over, straight up and down, ), Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M., get the money, Dollar dollar bill, y'all, [Outro: Method Man], Yeah, yeah, Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M., get the money, Dollar dollar bill, y'all, Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M., get the money, Dollar dollar bill, y'all, Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M., get the money, Dollar dollar bill, y'all, Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M., get the money, Dollar dollar bill, y'all-all-all, yeah, 224, Embed\", 'Protect Ya Neck Lyrics, [Skit], Caller: \"So whassup, man?\", DJ: \"Coolin\\', man.\", C: \"Chillin\\' chilin\\'?

that rocks from here to Oregon, Here\\'s more again, , catch it like a psycho flashback, I love gats, if rap was a gun, you wouldn\\'t bust back, I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds, And where I lounge is my stompin\\' grounds, I give an order to my peeps across the water, To go and snatch up props all around the border, And get far like a shootin\\' star, \\'Cause who I are is livin\\' the life of Pablo Escobar, Point-blank as I kick the square biz, There it is, you\\'re fuckin\\' with pros, and there it goes, [Verse 7: RZA], Yo, chill with the feedback, black, we don\\'t need that, It\\'s 10 o\\'clock, ho, where the fuck\\'s your seed at?, Feelin\\' mad hostile, wearing Aeropostale, Flowin\\' like Christ when I speaks the gospel, Stroll with the holy roll,,  , then

stuck to the gum under the table, That\\'s what you get when you misuse what I invent, Your empire falls and you lose every cent, For tryna blow up a scrub, Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb, Should\\'ve pumped it when I rocked it, Niggas so stingy they got , short arms and deep pockets, This goes on in some companies, With majors, , they\\'re scared to death to pump these, First of all, who\\'s your A&R?, A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?, But he don\\'t know the meanin\\' of dope, When he\\'s lookin\\' for a suit-and-tie rap, That\\'s cleaner than a bar of soap, And I\\'m the dirtiest thing in sight, Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let\\'s have a mud fight, [Outro: RZA], You best protect ya neck, You best protect ya neck, You best

satisfaction, People be hounding, always surrounding, Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding, You don\\'t really fret, you stay in your sense, Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense, You soar off to another world, deep in your mind, But people seem to take that, as being unkind, \"Oh yo he\\'s acting stank,\" really on a regal?, A man of the fame not a man of the people, Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much, Riding on the train with no dough, sucks, Once again a case of your feet in my Nike\\'s, If a crowd is in my realm I\\'m saying -- mic please, Hip-hop is living, can\\'t yank the plug, If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged, [Verse 4: Q-Tip], Yo, I am not an invalid although, I used to smoke the weed out, Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out, Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns, Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun, When I left for road, see, I was , Boulevard,  status, Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest, It was one MC after one MC, What the world could they be wanting see from little old me, Do I have the formula to save the world?, Or was it just because I used to, Swipe the women and all the girls, I\\'m the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid, Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did, Supposed to be my man, But now I wonder cause you\\'re feeble, I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils, It\\'s your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out, All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out, [Chorus], Buggin\\'

the crowd, When the guy takes the beat, they bowed, So raise up squire, adjust your attire, We have no time to wallow in the mire, If you\\'re on a foreign path, then let me do the lead, Join in the essence of the cool-out breed, Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene, With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things, Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work,

hemorrhoids, Before you try to fuck wit Ren, I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10, [Verse 2: Dr. Dre], First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve, Step up and get what you deserve, From the word of a muthafucking hip-hop maniac, Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back, Now how the fuck you think a rap will last?, Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past, Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy, Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy, [Verse 3: MC Ren], Falling deep in the drums so many of styles, Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles, Cheating and now beating, the crowd I kept seating, But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating, Styles that kept them full of bull, Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs,  and not getting paid in full, They got the nerve to cuss, Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us, [Verse 4: Dr. Dre], Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do, You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you?, You can't harm me, alarm me, Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army, The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know, We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo, Try us and take it, Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in, [Hook], It's the real thing, you are now real, real niggas, niggas, [Verse 5: MC Ren], You can run, but you can’t hide, you know I'mma find'cha, Cause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind'cha, Don’t look back because you’re shaking and all scared, A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare, So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on, Don't step on my muthafucking stage without nike's on, Don’t say it’s psycho and then you just might go, Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow, [Verse 6: Dr. Dre], All these niggas wit the jibber jabber, But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer, Gangstas in black are out there, But only because, yo, it’s the shit that we wear, On my muthafucking dick, But I'mma love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick, So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead, You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead, [Verse 7: Eazy-E + ,  MC Ren , ], Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see, A little streetwise nigga, you know me, Rolling wit some real niggas playing for keeps, But you muthafuckas know who run the streets, Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit, Now how much harder can another nigga get?, Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us, Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please, Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees, Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill, Eazy-E, a nigga that's real, [Interlude: DJ Yella], Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton, Quick to get in your shit without second thought, And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught, So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black, Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats, [Verse 8: MC Ren], They played out, that's what niggas were chanting, One nigga left and they said we ain't having it, People had thought we was finished and then done wit, But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit, Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears, And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas, And when the new record comes, I’ll come like a fucking bomb, Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb, You're on the dicks of four niggas not one, And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one, So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up, Cause if I let you slide, it’s just cause you lucked up, Don’t come in my face again, because I'mma floor ya, And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya, Because my attitude's a little bigga, Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas, [Verse 9: Dr. Dre], Lost in a muthafucking world of madness, Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad there's, Sucka muthafuckas like you, making wack jams, Because it only shows you how dope I am, Never try to ignore us, When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis, Cause I'm a real nigga, , but I guess you figure, You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger, Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that’s smart, A nigga that’s paid to say what others are scared to play, We started out wit too much cargo, So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold, Yo, N.W.A, criticize for what we say, But I'm a do the shit anyway, Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking, Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in, [Outro: MC Ren], N.W.A, straight outta muthafucking Compton, Taking over shit in all of the 1990's, Yo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella,

Remember the first nigga to run is the first to get shot, Whoever said that what I say and portray is negativity, Need to come kick it in the city with me, And find the black and crack the fact, And take that shit back, Cause they don\\'t wanna fuck with that, There\\'s too many niggas they\\'re trying to calm, If motherfuckers could get it, nobody would\\'ve fucked with it, Appetite for

noisy, A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze, He took a swing for my head, thought I was faded, Started running for the door but the fucker never made it, The sound of the nine went \"Bang!\", And all over the wall was his motherfucking brain, Cause I\\'m a nigga you can\\'t sleep on, So set the alarm cause I hit like a motherfucking bomb, I do damage with the nine in my hand, But the average nigga that don’t know me don’t understand, I\\'m from the streets, so therefore, You know I don\\'t care for a sucker that ain\\'t down, With the real niggas, the niggas, the niggas, Yo, and that\\'s the way shit gotta go ain\\'t even sober, Any time that the nine wanna leave, I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve, And it\\'s ready to go to war \\'cause that\\'s what it\\'s here for, I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more, And that\\'s the million and one, they couldn\\'t hang with the appetite, \\'cause they wasn\\'t rapping right, So I had to destroy whoever was standing

start the revolution all they probably do is squeal, But chill, see you on the next V-I, I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks, Your brother\\'s buckwildin\\' in 4-Main, he wrote me, He might beat his case, \\'til he come home I\\'ll play it lowkey, So stay civilized, time flies, Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries, It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala, I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love, [Hook: Q-Tip], One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one love, one

in school text books, bibles, et cetera, Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er, So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad for the weekend, Hittin\\' L\\'s while I\\'m sleepin\\', A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone, To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home, You see the streets had me stressed somethin\\' terrible, Fuckin\\' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue, Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10, A future in a maximum state pen is grim, So I comes back home, nobody\\'s out but Shorty Doo-Wop, Rollin\\' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call \\'em \"oo-wops\", He said: \"Nas, niggas caught me bustin\\' off the roof, So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.\", He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep, Started coughin\\', one eye peeked to watch me speak, I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black, We was chillin\\' on these benches, Where he pumped his loose cracks, I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard, Keeps me blasted and starts talkin\\' mad shit, I had to school him, told him don\\'t let niggas fool him, ‘Cause when the pistol blows, The one that\\'s murdered be the cool one, Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up, Coulda caught your man, but didn\\'t look when you bucked up, Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up, At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed, Shorty\\'s laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul, Only 12, tryin\\' to tell me that he liked my style, Then I rose, wipin\\' the blunt\\'s ash from my clothes, Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose, And told my little man I\\'ma ghost, I broze, Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose, Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above, Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love, [Hook: Q-Tip], One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one

Life, I wonder, Will it take me under?, I don\\'t know, [Verse 1: Nas], Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing, Imagine going to court with no trial, Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters, , no welfare supporters, More conscious of the way we raise our daughters, Days are shorter, nights are colder, Feeling like life is over, , these snakes strike like a cobra, The world\\'s hot, my son got knocked, evidently, It\\'s elementary, they want us all gone eventually, Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge, If coke was cooked without the garbage, We\\'d all have the top dollars, Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes, Lacing your clique up with , diamond Roles, Your people holding dough, , no parole, , no rubbers, Go in raw, , imagine , law with no undercovers, Just some thoughts for the mind, I take a glimpse into time, Watch the blimp read \"The World Is Mine\", [, Chorus, : , Lauryn Hill,  + (Nas)], If I ruled the world,  (Imagine that),

crash, then we laugh in a iller path, The Villa house is for the crew, how we do, Trees for breakfast, , , dime sexes,  and , Benz stretches, So many years of depression make me vision, The better living, type of place to raise kids in, Open they eyes to the lies, history\\'s told foul, But I\\'m as wise as the old owl, , plus the Gold Child, Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling, Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding, Trips to Paris, , I\\'d civilize every savage, Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish, Political prisoners set free, stress free, No work release, , purple M3\\'s,  and jet skis, Feel the wind breeze in West Indies, I\\'d let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, And reverse fiends to Willies, It sound foul, but every girl I meet\\'d go down-town, I\\'d open every cell in Attica, send \\'em to Africa, [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)], If I ruled the world (Imagine that), I\\'d free all my sons, , I love \\'em, love \\'em,

[Verse 3: Nas], You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry, Ducked down in car seats, heat\\'s mandatory, Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes, These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state, Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight, Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe, Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer, Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler, ‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich, Still, nobody want a nigga having shit, If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky\\'s the limit, I push a Q-45 Infinit(i), It wouldn\\'t be no such thing as jealousies , or B Felony, Strictly living longevity to the destiny, I thought I\\'d never see, but reality struck, Better find out before your time\\'s out, what the fuck?, [Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)], If I ruled the world (Imagine that), I\\'d free all my sons,, I love \\'em, love \\'em, baby, Black diamonds and pearls, (Could it be, if you could be mine, we\\'d both shine?), If I ruled the world, (Still living for today, in these last days and times), If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that), I\\'d free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled, I love \\'em, love \\'em baby, Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds, (Could it be, if you could be mine, we\\'d both shine), If I ruled the world, (Still living for today, in these last days and times), [Outro: Lauryn Hill], If I ruled the world, if I ruled, If I ruled, I\\'d free all my sons, Black diamonds, I love \\'em love \\'em baby, Black

a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules, I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years, We was poorer than the other little kids, And even though we had different daddies, the same drama, When things went wrong we'd blame Mama, I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell, Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell, And who'd think in elementary, hey, I'd see the penitentiary one day?, And runnin' from the police, that's right, Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside, And even as a crack fiend, Mama, You always was a black queen, Mama, I finally understand, For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man, You always was committed, A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it, There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan, Is to show you that I understand: you

Lyrics, [Part I: Dance with the Devil], [Verse 1], I once knew a nigga whose real name was William, His primary concern was makin\\' a million, Bein\\' the illest hustler that the world ever seen, He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams, A corrupted young mind at the age of 13, Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend, She put the pipe down, , but for every year she was sober, Her son\\'s heart simultaneously grew colder, He started hangin\\' out, sellin\\' bags in the projects, Checkin\\' the young chicks, lookin\\' for hit-and-run prospects, He was fascinated by material objects, But he understood money never bought respect, He built a reputation, \\'cause he could hustle and steal, But got locked once and didn\\'t hesitate to squeal, So criminals he chilled with didn\\'t think he was real, You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal, I don\\'t project my insecurities on other people, He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles, So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil, A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential, The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental, Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed, Dancin\\' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed, But he was sick of sellin\\' trees and gave in to his greed, [Hook], Everyone tryin\\' to be trife never face the consequences, You probably only did a month for minor offenses, Ask a nigga doin\\' life if he had another chance, But then again, there\\'s always the wicked that knew in advance, Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block, But that\\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock, Devils used to be God\\'s angels that fell from the top, There\\'s no diversity because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot, [Verse 2], So Billy started robbin\\' niggas, anything he could do, To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew, Startin\\' fights over little shit up on the block, Stepped up to sellin\\' mothers and brothers the crack rock, Workin\\' overtime for makin\\' money for the crack spot, Hit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine, Fulfillin\\' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain, Tired of the block niggas treatin\\' him the same, He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs, But when he tried to step to \\'em, niggas showed him no love, They told him any motherfuckin\\' coward can sell drugs, Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs, Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood, Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club, But only a real thug can stab someone \\'til they die, Standin\\' in front of them, starin\\' straight into their eyes, Billy realized that these men were well-guarded, And they wanted to test him before business started, Suggested rapin\\' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted, So now he had a choice between goin\\' back to his life, Or makin\\' money with made men up in the cyph\\', His dreams about cars and ice made him agree, A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be, And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three, [Hook], Everyone tryin\\' to be trife never face the consequences, You probably only did a month for minor offenses, Ask a nigga doin\\' life if he had another chance, But then again, there\\'s always the wicked that knew in advance, Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block, But that\\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock, Devils used to be God\\'s angels that fell from the top, There\\'s no diversity because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot, [Verse 3], They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin\\', Smokin\\' blunts, drinkin\\' and jokin\\' for entertainment, Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin\\' alone, Three in the mornin\\', comin\\' back from work, on her way home, And so they quietly got out the car and followed her, Walkin\\' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her, They wrapped her shirt around her head, And knocked her onto the floor, \"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw\", So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair, And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there, She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs, They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground, Screamin\\', \"Shut the fuck up, and stop movin\\' around!\", The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed, So Billy stomped on the bitch until he\\'d broken her jaw, The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin\\', They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin\\', Blood leakin\\' through the cloth, she cried silently, And then they all proceeded to rape her violently, Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn, Rippin\\' her up and chokin\\' her until her throat burned, Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren\\'t concerned, When they were done and she was lyin\\', Bloody, broken and bruised, One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22, They told him that she was a witness of what she\\'d gone through, And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew, He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead, And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head, [Sample], I\\'m fallin\\' and I can\\'t turn back, I\\'m fallin\\' and I can\\'t turn back, [Verse 4], Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life, He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice, And he felt strong standin\\' along with his new brothers, Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover, But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter, \\'Cause he was starin\\' into the eyes of his own mother, She looked back at him and cried \\'cause he had forsaken her, She cried more painfully than when they were rapin\\' her, His whole world stopped, he couldn\\'t even contemplate, His corruption had successfully changed his fate, And he remembered how his mom used to come home late, Workin\\' hard for nothin\\', because now what was he worth?, He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth, And cryin\\' out to the sky, \\'cause he was lonely and scared, But only the Devil responded, \\'cause God wasn\\'t there, And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold, And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul, They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it, After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it, And listen, \\'cause the story that I\\'m tellin\\' is true, \\'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too, And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go, In fact, I\\'m sure he\\'s standin\\' among one of you at my shows, And every street cypher, listenin\\' to little thugs flow, He could be standin\\' right next to you, and you wouldn\\'t know, The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked, White, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted, You have a self-destructive destiny when you\\'re inflicted, And you\\'ll be one of God\\'s children that fell from the top, There\\'s no diversity because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot, So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never, Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever, [Part TII \"I\"], [Intro: Immortal Technique], Oh, y\\'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh?, Well, it’s not, you didn’t count on a fallen angel gettin\\' back, Into the grace of God and comin\\' after you, Y’all niggas ain’t shit, your producers ain’t shit, Your fuckin\\' A & R ain’t shit, I’ll fuckin\\' wipe my ass with your demo deal, Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off!, [Verse 1: Diabolic], Go ‘head and grip Glocks, I’ll snap your trigger finger in six spots, You’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots, I’ll watch you topple flat, Put away your rings and holla back, Can’t freestyle; you’re screwed off the top, like bottle caps, Beneath the surface, I’m overheatin\\' your receiving circuits, By unleashin\\' deeper verses than priests speak in churches, What you preach is worthless, Your worship defeat the purpose, Like President Bush takin\\' bullets for the secret service, Beyond what y\\'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap \\'em, Show no compassion, like havin\\' a straight-faced orgasm, Tour jack \\'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend’s dick, In the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist, Diabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin\\' cancer plague, Fist-fuckin’ a pussy’s face, holdin\\' a hand grenade, So if I catch you bluffin\\', faggot, you’re less than nothin\\', I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction, [Verse 2: Immortal Technique], You motherfuckers are nothin\\', you cannot harm me, I’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army, Storm the planet, huntin\\' you down, \\'cause I’m on a mission, To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms, Immortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch, You’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix, I’m \\'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips, Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily, I’m like time itself: I’m gonna kill you inevitably, Chemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome piece, I’m Illmatic, you won’t make it home, like Jerome’s niece, I’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin\\' of dissin\\' me, And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy, This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology, So you’re nothin\\', like diversity without equality, And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology, Usin\\' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven, Produces more digits than 22 divided by seven, You’re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect, You never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin\\' thug yet, Your mind is empty and spacious, Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist, Face it, you’re too basic, you’re never gonna make it, Like children walkin\\' through Antarctica, butt-naked, 169, Embed', 'You Never Know Lyrics, [Verse 1: Immortal Technique], She was on her way to becomin\\' a college graduate, Wouldn\\'t even stop to talk to the average kid, The type of Latina I\\'d sit and contemplate marriage with, Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire, Disciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire, Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez, Everyone told me, kickin\\' it to her was hopeless, At first I just thought she didn\\'t mess with broke kids, The thug niggas always talkin\\' about how they smoke kids, But the rich sniff-coke kids got no play, \"I\\'m not even interested\" is what her body language would say, Everyone around the way gave up tryin\\' to get in it, It didn\\'t matter how good your game was, she wasn\\'t with it, On the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn\\'t admit it, Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it, Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it, And no one ever gave them shit except McDonald\\'s and did-dick, Smokin\\' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it, She spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin\\' to copy, But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy, She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure, I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn\\'t a cure, [Hook: Jean Grae], Don\\'t you know that time waits for no man?, My fate, it\\'s all planned, I\\'m blessed just to know you, I\\'ve loved and I\\'ve lost just to hold you all night, Can\\'t find a reason why, God came between you and I, And if I had the chance again, I\\'d never let you go, Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know, [Verse 2: Immortal Technique], Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad, I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad, That I wasn\\'t just another nigga tryin\\' to get in it, So every now and then we\\'d stop and talk for a minute, I didn\\'t have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours, On her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers, Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin\\'s baby shower, We talked about power to the people and such, We spent more time together, but it was never enough, I never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel, I was too interested in keepin\\' it real, Perfectly honest and complete, She would always call me \"cariño\" and never Technique, Bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks, Forever changin\\' the expression of my thoughts when I speak, It was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks, She convinced me to stop hangin\\' out on the streets, To stop robbin\\' and stealin\\' from people like you, Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo, Museo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too, Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew, So I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true, I couldn\\'t live without her, so I told her, facin\\' my fears, But honey\\'s only response was a face full of tears, She could only sob hysterically, holdin\\' me tight, I tried to speak, but she wouldn\\'t stop until I left sight, I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light, Except I didn\\'t burn, I turned cold after that night, [Hook: Jean Grae], Don\\'t you know that time waits for no man?, My fate, it\\'s all planned, I\\'m blessed just to know you, I\\'ve loved and I\\'ve lost just to hold you all night, Can\\'t find a reason why, God came between you and I, And if I had the chance again, I\\'d never let you go, Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know, [Verse 3: Immortal Technique], I went on with my life, college and my career, Ended up locked up like an animal for a year, Where the C.O.\\'s talk to you like they were the overseer, Then I got sent to the hole when my exit was near, At night in my cell, I\\'d close my eyes and I\\'d see her, Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared, Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole, In the summer, came back, intact and on track, But the fact of the matter is I still felt cold, Even after my mother hugged me, cryin\\' at home, My real niggas would catch me thinkin\\', outta my zone, Fuckin\\' lots of different women, but I still felt alone, Relatively well-known around the New York underground, But I kept thinkin\\' of her and how we used to be down, The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair, Though gone physically, somehow it was still there, I had to do somethin\\' because the shit was too much to bear, So I went and visited the building where she used to live, The world looks a lot different after you do a bid, The way your life done changed, While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game, Like her cousin who was on the corner, slangin\\' cocaine, Stepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name, Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta, But her facial expression changed, When I asked about her daughter, [Hook: Jean Grae], Don\\'t you know that time waits for no man?, My fate, it\\'s all planned, I\\'m blessed just to know you, I\\'ve loved and I\\'ve lost just to hold you all night, Can\\'t find a reason why, God came between you and I, And if I had the chance again, I\\'d never let you go, Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know, [Verse 4: Immortal Technique], She told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind, And she had left it there waitin\\' for such a long time, I was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first, I saw a tear swellin\\' up in her eye, and then she cursed, She told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin\\' the worst, Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door, And sure enough there was an envelope, With my name on the floor: \"Nobody loves you more than me, cariño,\" is what the letter said, \"By the time you get to read this, I\\'ll probably be dead, But when you left in \\'97, a part of me went to Heaven, I thank God at least I got to know what love really was, But it hurt me to see what true love really does, ‘Cause even though we never made love, You were all that there was, It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave, You made me doubt the way I thought, You made me want to believe, And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me, It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me, This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be, Baby, don\\'t you see?, I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV, Hope didn\\'t exist for me since late in 1993, I died a virgin, I wish I could\\'ve given myself to you, I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you, Promise that you\\'ll meet me in Paradise inevitably, No matter what, I\\'ll keep your love forever with me.\", What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur, But I remember wishin\\' that I was dead, instead of her, She was buried on August 3rd, The story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don\\'t fuckin\\' fall in love with people, Hold the person that you love closely if they\\'re next to you, The one you love, not the person that\\'ll simply have sex with you, Appreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond, ‘Cause you never really know what you got until it\\'s gone, 42, Embed', \"The Point of No Return Lyrics, [Intro], Yeah, it's that real this time around, Immortal Technique, , Revolutionary Vol. 2, It's on now, motherfucker, lock and load!, [Verse 1], This is the point of no return, I can never go back, Life without parole, upstate, shackled and trapped, Livin' in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack, But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped, I've gone too far, there ain't no comin' back for me, Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B, Just like the Spanish exterminatin' Tainos, Rapin' the black and Indian women, creating Latinos, Motherfuckers made me out of self-righteous hatred, And now you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix, A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow, Lethal injection, strapped down, ready to go, Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace?, Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets, Nat Turner with the sickle, pitchfork, and machete, The end of the world, motherfucker, you not ready, This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it, Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad, The comet that killed the dinosaurs, changin' the Earth, They love to criticize, they always say I change for the worse, Like prescription pills when you misusin' 'em, nigga, The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem, nigga, And figured out what was buried under Solomon's Temple, Al-Aqsa,,  , the name is not coincidental, I know too much, the government is tryin' to murder me, No comin' back, like cuttin' your wrists open vertically, How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country?, Genetic-engineered sickness spread amongst me, My people are so hungry that they attack without reason, Like a fuckin' dog rippin' off the hand that feeds him, Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act, So come and get me, motherfucker, 'cause I'm not comin' back, [Chorus], This is the point from which I can never return, And if I back down now, then forever I burn, This is the point from which I can never retreat, 'Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace, This is the point from which I will die or succeed, Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed, From now on, it can never be the same as before, 'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore, [Verse 2], This is the point of no return, nigga, , you better believe this, Mary Magdalene givin' birth to the children of Jesus, The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic, Human beings killin' monkeys to conquer the planet, The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia, Machine-gunnin' your body with depleted uranium, This is the age of microchips and titanium, The dark side of the Moon and contact with aliens, I started out like Australians: criminal-minded, Broke into Hell, tore it down, and built a city behind it, Southpaw, murderous methodology, nigga, Remember that I'm just a man, don't follow me, nigga, 'Cause once you past the point, you can never go home, You've got to face the possibility of dyin' alone, So tell me, motherfucker, how could you die for the throne, When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own?, It rains acid, one day the Earth will cry from a stone, And you'll be lookin' at the world, livin' inside of a dome, Computerized humanity livin' inside of a clone, This is the place where the unknown is livin' and real, Wormwood to Planet X and the Seventh Seal, Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal, This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky, 'Cause almost everything that I was ever told was a lie, [Chorus], This is the point from which I can never return, And if I back down now, then forever I burn, This is the point from which I can never retreat, 'Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace, This is the point from which I will die or succeed, Livin' the struggle, I know

the false image of the son of man, Shall stand before God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God), It has begun, the beginning of the end, Yeah ... yeah ... yeah, yeah, [Verse 1], The voice of racism preaching the gospel is devilish, A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist, Forgetting God is not religion, but a spiritual bond, And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran, They bombed innocent people, tryna murder Saddam, When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran, This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings, 'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemings, I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish, The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ, You murdered him, stole his religion, , and painted him white, Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy, Conservative political right-wing ideology, Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation, Got my back to the wall 'cause I'm facin' assassination, Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration, How could this be the land of the free, home of the brave, Indigenous holocaust, , , and the home of the slaves?, Corporate America dancin' offbeat to the rhythm, You really think this country never sponsored terrorism?, Human rights violations, we continue the saga, El Savador and the Contras in Nicaragua, And on top of that, you still want to take me to prison, Just 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism, [Chorus], It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain, Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change, They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto, The fourth branch of the government want us to settle, A bandanna full of glittering generality, Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?, Read about the history of the place that we live in, And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children, [Verse 2], Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs, Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage, The brink of holy war, bottled up like a miscarriage, Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension, And they refuse to even mention European intervention, Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams, US-manufactured missiles and M16s, Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams, Media censorship blockin’ out the video screens, A continent of oil kingdoms bought for a bargain, Democracy is just a word when the people are starvin', The average citizen made to be blind to the reason, A desert full of genocide where the bodies are freezin', And the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom, 'Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon, It's open season with the CIA buggin' my crib, Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid, Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live, I'm tryna give the truth and I know the price is my life, But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique, Who beheaded the president and the princes and sheiks, You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade, Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God, Bitch niggas scared of the truth when it looks at you hard, [Chorus], It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain, Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change, They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto, The fourth branch of the government want us to settle, A bandanna full of glittering generality, Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?, Martial law is coming soon to the hood to kill you, While you hangin’ your flag out your project window, [Outro], Yeah, The fourth branch of the government AKA the media, Seems to now have a retirement plan for ex-military officials, As if their opinion was at all unbiased, A machine shouldn't speak for men, So shut the fuck up, you mindless drone, And you know it's serious, When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign, To try to convince you they're fair and balanced, When they're some of the most ignorant and racist people, Giving that type of mentality a safe haven, We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do, We die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards, We don't get weapons contracts, nigga, We

Technique, Revolutionary Vol. 2, , yeah, Broadcasting live from Harlem, New York (Yeah), Let the truth be known, [Verse 1], You better watch what the fuck flies out of your mouth, Or I'ma hijack a plane and fly it into your house, Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch, And slit your throat so when you scream only blood comes out, I doubt that there could ever be a more wicked MC, 'Cause AIDS-infested child molesters aren't sicker than me, I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black, The way the government downplays historical facts, 'Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the Third Reich, Just like the CIA trained terrorists how to fight, Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight, When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic, But I refused the offer, 'cause God sent me to strike, With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke, My words'll expose George Bush and bin Laden, As two separate parts of the same seven-headed dragon, And you can't fathom the truth so you don't hear me, You think Illuminati's just a fuckin' conspiracy theory?, That's why conservative racists are all runnin' shit, And your phone is tapped by the federal government, So I'm jammin' frequencies in your brain when you speak to me, Technique’ll rip a rapper to pieces indecently, Pack weapons illegally, 'cause I'm never hesitant, Sniper-scopin' a commission controllin' the president, [Chorus], Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong, The truth’ll set you free, written down in this song, And the song has the cause of death written in code, The word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul, Save your soul, motherfucker, save your soul, Yeah, yeah, yeah, [Verse 2], I hacked the Pentagon for self-incriminating evidence, Of Republican-manufactured white powder pestilence, Marines Corps flak vest, with the guns and ammo, Spittin' bars like a demon stuck inside a piano, Turn a Sambo into a soldier, with just one line, So here's the truth about the system that'll fuck up your mind, They gave al-Qaeda six billion dollars in 1989 to 1992, And now the last chapters of Revelations are comin' true, And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this, 'Cause subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics, But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings, In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children, I was watchin' the towers, and though I wasn't the closest, I saw them crumble to the earth like they were full of explosives, And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did, About the bombs planted on the George Washington Bridge, Four non-Arabs arrested during the emergency, And then it disappeared from the news permanently, They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof, Jealous of our freedom? I can't believe you bought that excuse!, Rockin' a motherfuckin' flag don't make you a hero, Word to Ground Zero, The Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the seventh, The New World Order was born on September 11th, [Chorus], Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong, The truth’ll set you free, written down in this song, And the song has the cause of death written in code, The word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul, Save your soul, motherfucker, save your soul, [Verse 3], And just so conservatives don't take it to heart, I don't think Bush did it, 'cause he isn't that smart, He's just a stupid puppet takin' orders on his cell phone, From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone, The military industry got it poppin' and lockin', Lookin' for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine, And as a matter of fact, , Rumsfeld,,  now that I think back, Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq, Or a defense budget of world conquest proportions, Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortion, Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked, But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted, And Dick Cheney, you fuckin' leech, tell ‘em your plans, About building your pipelines through Afghanistan, And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan, You might have some house niggas fooled, but I understand, Colonialism is sponsored by corporations, That's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations, Tell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis, I know the CIA saw bin Laden on dialysis, In '98 when he was top ten for the FBI, Government ties is really why the government lies, Read it yourself instead of askin' the government why, 'Cause then the cause of death'll cause the propaganda to die, [Outro], Father, Forgive them, [Sample], He is scheduled for , 60 Minutes,  next.

Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag, Tryna confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:, Capitalism and democracy are not synonymous, You swallow propaganda like a birth control pill, Sellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill, But that'll never be me 'cause I'm leavin' the past, Like an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass, Like a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash, Unbreakable Technique, leavin' the plane crash, I'm out with the black box and I refuse to return, I spit reality instead of what you usually learn, And I refuse to be concerned with condescending advice, 'Cause I'm the only motherfucker that could change my life, [Trumpet Solo], [Outro], Some people think I won't make it, but I know that I will, Escape the emptiness 'cause that shit is slow and it kills, The flow and the skill, I made y'all believe it at last, You can make the future, but it starts with leavin' the past, [Trumpet Solo], 11, Embed\", 'The Poverty of Philosophy Lyrics, [Verse 1], Most of my Latino and black people who are struggling to get food, clothes and shelter in the hood are so concerned with that, that , philosophising about freedom and socialist democracy is usually unfortunately beyond their rationale.,  They don\\'t realize that America can\\'t exist without separating them from their identity, because , if we had some sense of who we really are, there\\'s no way in hell we\\'d allow this country to push it\\'s genocidal consensus on our homelands.,  , This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed, Niggas talk about change and working within the system to achieve that, The problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it\\'s not you who changes the system; it\\'s the system that will eventually change you, There is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely,  And I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I\\'ve been alive to know that it\\'s a serious problem, Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism, You see, , third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, , and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials, But plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and , traditionally oppressive European states, , , force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources, I\\'m quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words, My revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others, You see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America, Aside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States, Places like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well, As different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we\\'ll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined, And that\\'s why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, , or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques, But you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people, \"Fuck them, let them fend for themselves.\" No, fuck you, they are you, No matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in, or follow an anorexic standard of beauty, or no matter , how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them, , no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on, you will never be them, They\\'re always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey. I\\'d rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I\\'m really not, just to fit in, And whether we want to accept it or not, that\\'s what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us, I want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn\\'t have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We\\'re given the idea that if we didn\\'t have these people to exploit then America wouldn\\'t be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living, No, that\\'s wrong. , It\\'s the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money, We have whatever they kick down to us, My enemy is not the average white man, it\\'s not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don\\'t see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies, The generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real motherfuckers that I need to bring it to, Not the poor, broke country-ass soldier that\\'s too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up, In fact, I have more in common with most working- and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people, As much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue, ., Many of us are in the same boat and it\\'s sinking, while these bougie motherfuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we\\'re all in, we\\'re gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole, In other words, I don\\'t want to escape the plantation, I want to come back, free all my people, hang the motherfucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground, I want to take over the encomienda and give it back to the people who work the land, You cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a fucking lethargic devil, I don\\'t look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole, Most of those successful individuals are sellouts and house negroes, But, I don\\'t consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto, Poverty has nothing to do with our people. It\\'s not in our culture to be poor, That\\'s only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture, and forms of government, You know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois League, The idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That\\'s why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people cause he represented the agenda of White Spaniards once he was captured, Not the Aztec people who would become Mexicans, So in conclusion, I\\'m not gonna vote for anybody just cause they Black or Latino.

Reach for your glasses, I\\'ll burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards, Innocent deep in a casket—Colombian fashion, Intoxicated off the flow like thug\\'s passion, You motherfuckers will never get me to stop blasting, You\\'re better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion, You\\'re better off begging for twenty points from a label, You\\'re better off battling cancer under telephone cables, Technique chemically unstable, set to explode, Foretold by the dead sea scrolls written in code, So if your message ain’t shit, fuck the records you sold!, \\'Cause if you go platinum, it\\'s got nothing to do with luck, It just means that a million people are stupid as fuck, Stuck in the underground, a general that rose to the limit, Without distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick, Revolutionary Volume 2,  murder the critics, And leave your fucking body rotting for the roaches and crickets, [Hook], This is the business, and y\\'all ain’t getting nothing for free, And if you devils play broke, then I\\'m taking your company, You could call it reparations or restitution, Lock and load, nigga.

And where I lounge is my stompin\\' grounds, I give an order to my peeps across the water, To go and snatch up props all around the border, And get far like a shootin\\' star, \\'Cause who I are is

stuck to the gum under the table, That\\'s what you get when you misuse what I invent, Your empire falls and you lose every cent, For tryna blow up a scrub, Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb, Should\\'ve pumped it when I rocked it, Niggas so stingy they got , short arms and deep pockets, This goes on in some companies, With majors, , they\\'re scared to death to pump these, First of all, who\\'s your A&R?, A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar?, But he don\\'t know the meanin\\' of dope, When he\\'s lookin\\' for a suit-and-tie rap, That\\'s cleaner than a bar of soap, And I\\'m the dirtiest thing in sight, Matter of fact, bring out the girls, and let\\'s have a mud fight, [Outro: RZA], You best protect ya neck, You best protect ya neck, You best

\"Bang!\", And all over the wall was his motherfucking brain, Cause I\\'m a nigga you can\\'t sleep on, So set the alarm cause I hit like a motherfucking bomb, I do damage with the nine in my hand,

shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more, And that\\'s the million and one, they couldn\\'t hang with the appetite, \\'cause they wasn\\'t rapping right, So I had to destroy whoever was standing

will put that ass on fire, Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers, But maintain, when you come home the corner\\'s ours, On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal, When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal, But chill, see you on the next V-I, I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks, Your brother\\'s buckwildin\\' in 4-Main, he wrote me, He might beat his case, \\'til he come home I\\'ll play it lowkey, So stay civilized, time flies, Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries, It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala, I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love, [Hook: Q-Tip], One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one love, one love, one love, [Verse 3: Nas], Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack, Mind\\'s in another world, thinkin\\', \"How can we exist through the facts?\", Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera, Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er, So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad for the weekend, Hittin\\' L\\'s while I\\'m sleepin\\', A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone, To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home, You see the streets had me stressed somethin\\' terrible, Fuckin\\' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue, Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10, A future in a maximum state pen is grim, So I comes back home, nobody\\'s out but Shorty Doo-Wop, Rollin\\' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call \\'em \"oo-wops\", He said: \"Nas, niggas caught me bustin\\' off the roof, So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.\", He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep, Started coughin\\', one eye peeked to watch me speak, I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black, We was chillin\\' on these benches, Where he pumped his loose cracks, I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard, Keeps me blasted and starts talkin\\' mad shit, I had to school him, told him don\\'t let niggas fool him, ‘Cause when the pistol blows, The one that\\'s murdered be the cool one, Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up, Coulda caught your man, but didn\\'t look when you bucked up, Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up, At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed, Shorty\\'s laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul, Only 12, tryin\\' to tell me that he liked my style, Then I rose, wipin\\' the blunt\\'s ash from my clothes, Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose, And told my little man I\\'ma ghost, I broze, Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose, Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above, Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love, [Hook: Q-Tip], One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one love, one love, one love, One love, one

Life, I wonder, Will it take me under?, I don\\'t know, [Verse 1: Nas], Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing, Imagine going to court with no trial, Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters, , no welfare supporters, More conscious of the way we raise our daughters, Days are shorter, nights are colder, Feeling like life is over, , these snakes strike like a cobra, The world\\'s hot, my son got knocked, evidently, It\\'s elementary, they want us all gone eventually, Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge, If coke was cooked without the garbage, We\\'d all have the top dollars, Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes, Lacing your clique up with , diamond Roles, Your people holding dough, , no parole, , no rubbers, Go in raw, , imagine , law with no undercovers, Just some thoughts for the mind, I take a glimpse into time, Watch the blimp read \"The World Is Mine\", [, Chorus, : , Lauryn Hill,  + (Nas)], If I ruled the world,  (Imagine that),

living, type of place to raise kids in, Open they eyes to the lies, history\\'s told foul, But I\\'m as wise as the old owl, , plus the Gold Child, Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling, Tricking six digits on kicks and still holding, Trips to Paris, , I\\'d civilize every savage, Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish, Political prisoners set free, stress free, No work release, , purple M3\\'s,  and jet skis, Feel the wind breeze in West Indies, I\\'d let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, And reverse fiends to Willies, It sound foul, but every girl I

a Q-45 Infinit(i), It wouldn\\'t be no such thing as jealousies , or B Felony, Strictly living longevity to the destiny, I thought I\\'d never see, but reality struck, Better find out before your

on some truancy, But when I ended things with her it was just you and me, Doing me good, that's what I thought at first, Me and you together, swear to God that's all that worked, Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work), Uh, my heart is hard at work, We been together like ten years, Goddamn, took me as a young man, Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go, What will they write upon my grave?, A free man born as a king, who died as a slave, But everything he gave her was for nothing though, Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go, You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas, All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous, All I know is I'm living the life I never would, Finally let you go, I thought I never could, Don't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared, Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there, Tried to run but my legs won't, I look away but my head don't, I love it when you're fresh, I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath, I hate it that I need you, Nikki, But I love it when I feed you, Nikki, I hate that I bleed for you, Uh, I long and I need for you, But I love it when I taste you (Taste you), Nothing can replace you (Replace you), I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go, But you're everywhere I long to be, And all these other people that don't seem to understand, I'm just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me, Man you're everything I crave, You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave, I'm a king, you're my Coretta, But

Devil Lyrics, [Part I: Dance with the Devil], [Verse 1], I once knew a nigga whose real name was William, His primary concern was makin\\' a million, Bein\\' the illest hustler that the world ever seen, He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams, A corrupted young mind at the age of 13, Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend, She put the pipe down, , but for every year she was sober, Her son\\'s heart simultaneously grew colder, He started hangin\\' out, sellin\\' bags in the projects, Checkin\\' the young chicks, lookin\\' for hit-and-run prospects, He was fascinated by material objects, But he understood money never bought respect, He built a reputation, \\'cause he could hustle and steal, But got locked once and didn\\'t hesitate to squeal, So criminals he chilled with didn\\'t think he was real, You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal, I don\\'t project my insecurities on other people, He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles, So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil, A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential, The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental, Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed, Dancin\\' with the Devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed, But he was sick of sellin\\' trees and gave in to his greed, [Hook], Everyone tryin\\' to be trife never face the consequences, You probably only did a month for minor offenses, Ask a nigga doin\\' life if he had another chance, But then again, there\\'s always the wicked that knew in advance, Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block, But that\\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock, Devils used to be God\\'s angels that fell from the top, There\\'s no diversity because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot, [Verse 2], So Billy started robbin\\' niggas, anything he could do, To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew, Startin\\' fights over little shit up on the block, Stepped up to sellin\\' mothers and brothers the crack rock, Workin\\' overtime for makin\\' money for the crack spot, Hit the jackpot, and wanted to move up to cocaine, Fulfillin\\' the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain, Tired of the block niggas treatin\\' him the same, He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs, But when he tried to step to \\'em, niggas showed him no love, They told him any motherfuckin\\' coward can sell drugs, Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs, Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood, Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club, But only a real thug can stab someone \\'til they die, Standin\\' in front of them, starin\\' straight into their eyes, Billy realized that these men were well-guarded, And they wanted to test him before business started, Suggested rapin\\' a bitch to prove he was cold-hearted, So now he had a choice between goin\\' back to his life, Or makin\\' money with made men up in the cyph\\', His dreams about cars and ice made him agree, A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be, And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three, [Hook], Everyone tryin\\' to be trife never face the consequences, You probably only did a month for minor offenses, Ask a nigga doin\\' life if he had another chance, But then again, there\\'s always the wicked that knew in advance, Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block, But that\\'s what happens when you rape, murder, and sell rock, Devils used to be God\\'s angels that fell from the top, There\\'s no diversity because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot, [Verse 3], They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin\\', Smokin\\' blunts, drinkin\\' and jokin\\' for entertainment, Until they saw a woman on the street, walkin\\' alone, Three in the mornin\\', comin\\' back from work, on her way home, And so they quietly got out the car and followed her, Walkin\\' through the projects, the darkness swallowed her, They wrapped her shirt around her head, And knocked her onto the floor, \"This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw\", So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair, And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there, She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs, They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground, Screamin\\', \"Shut the fuck up, and stop movin\\' around!\", The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed, So Billy stomped on the bitch until he\\'d broken her jaw, The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin\\', They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin\\', Blood leakin\\' through the cloth, she cried silently, And then they all proceeded to rape her violently, Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn, Rippin\\' her up and chokin\\' her until her throat burned, Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren\\'t concerned, When they were done and she was lyin\\', Bloody, broken and bruised, One of them niggas pulled out a brand new .22, They told him that she was a witness of what she\\'d gone through, And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew, He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead, And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head, [Sample], I\\'m fallin\\' and I can\\'t turn back, I\\'m fallin\\' and I can\\'t turn back, [Verse 4], Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life, He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice, And he felt strong standin\\' along with his new brothers, Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover, But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter, \\'Cause he was starin\\' into the eyes of his own mother, She looked back at him and cried \\'cause he had forsaken her, She cried more painfully than when they were rapin\\' her, His whole world stopped, he couldn\\'t even contemplate, His corruption had successfully changed his fate, And he remembered how his mom used to come home late, Workin\\' hard for nothin\\', because now what was he worth?, He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth, And cryin\\' out to the sky, \\'cause he was lonely and scared, But only the Devil responded, \\'cause God wasn\\'t there, And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold, And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul, They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it, After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it, And listen, \\'cause the story that I\\'m tellin\\' is true, \\'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too, And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go, In fact, I\\'m sure he\\'s standin\\' among one of you at my shows, And every street cypher, listenin\\' to little thugs flow, He could be standin\\' right next to you, and you wouldn\\'t know, The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked, White, brown, yellow and black — color is not restricted, You have a self-destructive destiny when you\\'re inflicted, And you\\'ll be one of God\\'s children that fell from the top, There\\'s no diversity because we\\'re burnin\\' in the melting pot, So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never, Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever, [Part TII \"I\"], [Intro: Immortal Technique], Oh, y\\'all

like bottle caps, Beneath the surface, I’m overheatin\\' your receiving circuits, By unleashin\\' deeper verses than priests speak in churches, What you preach is worthless, Your worship defeat the purpose, Like President Bush takin\\' bullets for the secret service, Beyond what y\\'all fathom, I shit on cats and jaw tap \\'em, Show no compassion, like havin\\' a straight-faced orgasm, Tour jack \\'em, have his half-a-10 bitch suck my friend’s dick, In the meantime, you can french kiss this clenched fist, Diabolic: a one-man brigade spreadin\\' cancer plague, Fist-fuckin’ a pussy’s face, holdin\\' a hand grenade, So if I catch you bluffin\\', faggot, you’re less than nothin\\', I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction, [Verse 2: Immortal Technique], You motherfuckers are nothin\\', you cannot harm me, I’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army, Storm the planet, huntin\\' you down, \\'cause I’m on a mission, To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms, Immortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch, You’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix, I’m \\'bout to blow up, like NASA Challenger computer chips, Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily, I’m like time itself: I’m gonna kill you inevitably, Chemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome piece, I’m Illmatic, you won’t make it home, like Jerome’s niece, I’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin\\' of dissin\\' me, And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy, This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology, So you’re nothin\\', like diversity without equality, And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology, Usin\\' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven, Produces more digits than 22 divided by seven, You’re like Kevin Spacey: your style is usually suspect, You never killed a cop, you, not a motherfuckin\\' thug yet, Your mind is empty and spacious, Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist, Face it, you’re too basic, you’re never gonna make it, Like children walkin\\' through Antarctica, butt-naked, 169, Embed', 'You Never Know Lyrics, [Verse 1: Immortal Technique], She was on her way to becomin\\' a college graduate, Wouldn\\'t even stop to talk to the average kid, The type of Latina I\\'d sit and contemplate marriage with, Fuck the horse and carriage shit, her love was never for hire, Disciplined, intellectual beauty is what I desire, Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez, Everyone told me, kickin\\' it to her was hopeless, At first I just thought she didn\\'t mess with broke kids, The thug niggas always talkin\\' about how they smoke kids, But the rich sniff-coke kids got no play, \"I\\'m not even interested\" is what her body language would say, Everyone around the way gave up tryin\\' to get in it, It didn\\'t matter how good your game was, she wasn\\'t with it, On the block, bitches was jealous but wouldn\\'t admit it, Talk shit, and deny to everyone that they did it, Cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it, And no one ever gave them shit except McDonald\\'s and did-dick, Smokin\\' weed, with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it, She spoke intelligently and they bit it, always tryin\\' to copy, But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy, She had a style, all her own, respectful and pure, I was sick in the head for her, and there wasn\\'t a cure, [Hook: Jean Grae], Don\\'t you know that time waits for no man?, My fate, it\\'s all planned, I\\'m blessed just to know

‘cause you never know, [Verse 2: Immortal Technique], Her eyes are brown and beautiful, yet empty and sad, I used to talk to her occasionally, and she was glad, That I wasn\\'t just another nigga tryin\\' to get in it, So every now and then we\\'d stop and talk for a minute, I didn\\'t have a gimmick, so the minutes turned to hours, On her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers, Then I took her out to dinner after her cousin\\'s baby shower, We talked about power to the people and such, We spent more time together, but it was never enough, I never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel, I was too interested in keepin\\' it real, Perfectly honest and complete, She would always call me \"cariño\" and never Technique, Bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks, Forever changin\\' the expression of my thoughts when I speak, It was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks, She convinced me to stop hangin\\' out on the streets, To stop robbin\\' and stealin\\' from people like you, Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo, Museo del Barrio, and the Metropolitan too, Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew, So I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true, I couldn\\'t live without her, so I told her, facin\\' my fears, But honey\\'s only response was a face full of tears, She could only sob hysterically, holdin\\' me tight, I tried to speak, but she wouldn\\'t stop until I left sight, I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light, Except I didn\\'t burn, I turned cold after that night, [Hook: Jean Grae], Don\\'t you know that time waits for no man?, My fate, it\\'s all planned, I\\'m blessed just to know you, I\\'ve loved and I\\'ve lost just to hold you all night, Can\\'t find a reason why, God came between you and I, And if I had the chance again, I\\'d never let you go, Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know, [Verse 3: Immortal Technique], I went on with my life, college and my career, Ended up locked up like an animal for a year, Where the C.O.\\'s talk to you like they were the overseer, Then I got sent to the hole when my exit was near, At night in my cell, I\\'d close my eyes and I\\'d see her, Hold her close in my dreams, but when I woke she disappeared, Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole, In the summer, came back, intact and on track, But the fact of the matter is I still felt cold, Even after my mother hugged me, cryin\\' at home, My real niggas would catch me thinkin\\', outta my zone, Fuckin\\' lots of different women, but I still felt alone, Relatively well-known around the New York underground, But I kept thinkin\\' of her and how we used to be down, The sound of her voice, and the beautiful smell of her hair, Though gone physically, somehow it was still there, I had to do somethin\\' because the shit was too much to bear, So I went and visited the building where she used to live, The world looks a lot different after you do a bid, The way your life done changed, While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game, Like her cousin who was on the corner, slangin\\' cocaine, Stepped in the lobby, and tapped the button next to her last name, Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta, But her facial expression changed, When I asked about her daughter, [Hook: Jean Grae], Don\\'t you know that time waits for no man?, My fate, it\\'s all planned, I\\'m blessed just to know you, I\\'ve loved and I\\'ve lost just to hold you all night, Can\\'t find a reason why, God came between you and I, And if I had the chance again, I\\'d never let you go, Hold tight to your love, ‘cause you never know, [Verse 4: Immortal Technique], She told me that there was a note, for me, that was left behind, And she had left it there waitin\\' for such a long time, I was inclined to ask about it, but she brought it up first, I saw a tear swellin\\' up in her eye, and then she cursed, She told me where the letter was, and I started thinkin\\' the worst, Reversed my position, stepped over and opened the door, And sure enough there was an envelope, With my name on the floor: \"Nobody loves you more than me, cariño,\" is what the letter said, \"By the time you get to read this, I\\'ll probably be dead, But when you left in \\'97, a part of me went to Heaven, I thank God at least I got to know what love really was, But it hurt me to see what true love really does, ‘Cause even though we never made love, You were all that there was, It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave, You made me doubt the way I thought, You made me want to believe, And then I slipped up, and I let you get close to me, It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me, This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be, Baby, don\\'t you see?, I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV, Hope didn\\'t exist for me since late in 1993, I died a virgin, I wish I could\\'ve given myself to you, I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you, Promise that you\\'ll meet me in Paradise inevitably, No matter what, I\\'ll keep your love forever with me.\", What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur, But I remember wishin\\' that I was dead, instead of her, She was buried on August 3rd, The story ends without a sequel; and now you know why Technique don\\'t fuckin\\' fall in love with people, Hold the person that you love closely if they\\'re next to you, The one you love, not the person that\\'ll simply have sex with you, Appreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond, ‘Cause you never really know what you got until it\\'s gone, 42, Embed', \"The Point of No Return Lyrics, [Intro], Yeah, it's that real this time around, Immortal Technique, , Revolutionary Vol. 2, It's on now, motherfucker, lock and load!, [Verse 1], This is the point of no return, I can never go back, Life without parole, upstate, shackled and trapped, Livin' in the hole, lookin' at the world through a crack, But fuck that, I'd rather shoot it out and get clapped, I've gone too far, there ain't no comin' back for me, Auschwitz gas chamber full of Zyklon-B, Just like the Spanish exterminatin' Tainos, Rapin' the black and Indian women, creating Latinos, Motherfuckers made me out of self-righteous hatred, And now you got yourself a virus, stuck in the Matrix, A suicide bomber strapped and ready to blow, Lethal injection, strapped down, ready to go, Don't you understand they'll never let me live out in peace?, Concrete jungle, guerrilla war out in the streets, Nat Turner with the sickle, pitchfork, and machete, The end of the world, motherfucker, you not ready, This is the point of no return and nobody can stop it, Malcolm Little when he knelt before Elijah Muhammad, The comet that killed the dinosaurs, changin' the Earth, They love to criticize, they always say I change for the worse, Like prescription pills when you misusin' 'em, nigga, The Templar Knights when they took Jerusalem, nigga, And figured out what was buried under Solomon's Temple, Al-Aqsa,,  , the name is not coincidental, I know too much, the government is tryin' to murder me, No comin' back, like cuttin' your wrists open vertically, How could the serpent be purposely put in charge of the country?, Genetic-engineered sickness spread amongst me, My people are so hungry that they attack without reason, Like a fuckin' dog rippin' off the hand that feeds him, Immortal Technique is treason to the Patriot Act, So come and get me, motherfucker, 'cause I'm not comin' back, [Chorus], This is the point from which I can never return, And if I back down now, then forever I burn, This is the point from which I can never retreat, 'Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace, This is the point from which I will die or succeed, Livin' the struggle, I know I'm alive when I bleed, From now on, it can never be the same as before, 'Cause the place that I'm from doesn't exist anymore, [Verse 2], This is the point of no return, nigga, , you better believe this, Mary Magdalene givin' birth to the children of Jesus, The evolution of the world, bloody and dramatic, Human beings killin' monkeys to conquer the planet, The kingdoms of Africa and Mesopotamia, Machine-gunnin' your body with depleted uranium, This is the age of microchips and titanium, The dark side of the Moon and contact with aliens, I started out like Australians: criminal-minded, Broke into Hell, tore it down, and built a city behind it, Southpaw, murderous methodology, nigga, Remember that I'm just a man, don't follow me, nigga, 'Cause once you past the point, you can never go home, You've got to face the possibility of dyin' alone, So tell me, motherfucker, how could you die for the throne, When you don't even got the fuckin' heart to die for your own?, It rains acid, one day the Earth will cry from a stone, And you'll be lookin' at the world, livin' inside of a dome, Computerized humanity livin' inside of a clone, This is the place where the unknown is livin' and real, Wormwood to Planet X and the Seventh Seal, Universal truth is not measured in mass appeal, This is the last time that I kneel and pray to the sky, 'Cause almost everything that I was ever told was a lie, [Chorus], This is the point from which I can never return, And if I back down now, then forever I burn, This is the point from which I can never retreat, 'Cause if I turn back now there can never be peace, This is the point from which I will die or succeed, Livin' the struggle, I know

the false image of the son of man, Shall stand before God (God, God, God, God, God, God, God), It has begun, the beginning of the end, Yeah ... yeah ... yeah, yeah, [Verse 1], The voice of racism preaching the gospel is devilish, A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist, Forgetting God is not religion, but a spiritual bond, And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran, They bombed innocent people, tryna murder Saddam, When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran, This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings, 'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemings, I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish, The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ, You murdered him, stole his religion, , and painted him white, Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy, Conservative political right-wing ideology, Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation, Got my back to the wall 'cause I'm facin' assassination, Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration, How could this be the land of the free, home of the brave, Indigenous holocaust, , , and the home of the slaves?, Corporate America dancin' offbeat to the rhythm, You really think this country never sponsored terrorism?, Human rights violations, we continue the saga, El Savador and the Contras in Nicaragua, And on top of that, you still want to take me to prison, Just 'cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism, [Chorus], It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain, Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change, They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto, The fourth branch of the government want us to settle, A bandanna full of glittering generality, Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?, Read about the history of the place that we live in, And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children, [Verse 2], Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs, Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage, The brink of holy war, bottled up like a miscarriage, Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension, And they refuse to even mention European intervention, Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams, US-manufactured missiles and M16s, Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams, Media censorship blockin’ out the video screens, A continent of oil kingdoms bought for a bargain, Democracy is just a word when the people are starvin', The average citizen made to be blind to the reason, A desert full of genocide where the bodies are freezin', And the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom, 'Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon, It's open season with the CIA buggin' my crib, Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid, Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live, I'm tryna give the truth and I know the price is my life, But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique, Who beheaded the president and the princes and sheiks, You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade, Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God, Bitch niggas scared of the truth when it looks at you hard, [Chorus], It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain, Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change, They want to rearrange

same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign, To try to convince you they're fair and balanced, When they're some of the most ignorant and racist people, Giving that type of mentality a safe haven, We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do, We die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards, We don't get weapons contracts, nigga, We

plane and fly it into your house, Burn your apartment with your family tied to the couch, And slit your throat so when you scream only blood comes out, I doubt that there could ever be a more wicked MC, 'Cause AIDS-infested child molesters aren't sicker than me, I see the world for what it is, beyond the white and the black, The way the government downplays historical facts, 'Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the Third Reich, Just like the CIA trained terrorists how to fight, Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight, When I was a child, the Devil himself bought me a mic, But I refused the offer, 'cause God sent me to strike, With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke, My words'll expose George Bush and bin Laden, As two separate parts of the same seven-headed dragon, And you can't fathom the truth so you don't hear me, You think Illuminati's just a fuckin' conspiracy theory?, That's why conservative racists are all runnin' shit, And your phone is tapped by the federal government, So I'm jammin' frequencies in your brain when you speak to me, Technique’ll rip a rapper to pieces indecently, Pack weapons illegally, 'cause I'm never hesitant, Sniper-scopin' a commission controllin' the president, [Chorus], Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong, The truth’ll set you free, written down in this song, And the song has the cause of death

evidence, Of Republican-manufactured white powder pestilence, Marines Corps flak vest, with the guns and ammo, Spittin' bars like a demon stuck inside a piano, Turn a Sambo into a soldier, with just one line, So here's the truth about the system that'll fuck up your mind, They gave al-Qaeda six billion dollars in 1989 to 1992, And now the last chapters of Revelations are comin' true, And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this, 'Cause subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics, But you act like America wouldn't destroy two buildings, In a country that was sponsoring bombs dropped on our children, I was watchin' the towers, and though I wasn't the closest, I saw them crumble to the earth like they were full of explosives, And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did, About the bombs planted on the George Washington Bridge, Four non-Arabs arrested during the emergency, And then it disappeared from the news permanently, They dubbed a tape of Osama, and they said it was proof, Jealous of our freedom? I can't believe you bought that excuse!, Rockin' a motherfuckin' flag don't make you a hero, Word to Ground Zero, The Devil crept into Heaven, God overslept on the seventh, The New World Order was born on September 11th, [Chorus], Father, forgive them, for they don't know right from wrong, The truth’ll set you free, written down in this song, And the song has the cause of death written in code, The word of God brought to life, that'll save your soul, Save your soul, motherfucker, save your soul, [Verse 3], And just so conservatives don't take it to heart, I don't think Bush did it, 'cause he isn't that smart, He's just a stupid puppet takin' orders on his cell phone, From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone, The military industry got it poppin' and lockin', Lookin' for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine, And as a matter of fact, , Rumsfeld,,  now that I think back, Without 9/11, you couldn't have a war in Iraq, Or a defense budget of world conquest proportions, Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortion, Tax cut extortion, a blessing to the wealthy and wicked, But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted, And Dick Cheney, you fuckin' leech, tell ‘em your plans, About building your pipelines through Afghanistan, And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan, You might have some house niggas fooled, but I understand, Colonialism is sponsored by corporations, That's why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations, Tell me the truth, I don't scare into paralysis, I know the CIA saw bin Laden on dialysis, In '98 when he was top ten for the FBI, Government ties is really why the government lies, Read it yourself instead of askin' the government why, 'Cause then the cause of death'll cause the propaganda to die, [Outro], Father, Forgive them, [Sample], He is scheduled for , 60 Minutes,  next.

Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag, Tryna confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:, Capitalism and democracy are not synonymous, You swallow propaganda like a birth control pill, Sellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill, But that'll never be me 'cause I'm leavin' the past, Like an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass, Like a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash, Unbreakable Technique, leavin' the plane crash, I'm out with the black box and I refuse to return, I spit reality instead of what you usually learn, And I refuse to be concerned with condescending advice, 'Cause I'm the only motherfucker that could change my life, [Trumpet Solo], [Outro], Some people think I won't make it, but I know that I will, Escape the emptiness 'cause that shit is slow and it kills, The flow and the skill, I made y'all believe it at last, You can make the future, but it starts with leavin' the past, [Trumpet Solo], 11, Embed\", 'The Poverty of Philosophy Lyrics, [Verse 1], Most of my Latino and black people who are struggling to get food, clothes and shelter in the hood are so concerned with that, that , philosophising about freedom and socialist democracy is usually unfortunately beyond their rationale.,  They don\\'t realize that America can\\'t exist without separating them from their identity, because , if we had some sense of who we really are, there\\'s no way in hell we\\'d allow this country to push it\\'s genocidal consensus on our homelands.,  , This ignorance exists, but it can be destroyed, Niggas talk about change and working within the system to achieve that, The problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within, it\\'s not you who changes the system; it\\'s the system that will eventually change you, There is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation, but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely,  And I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that I\\'ve been alive to know that it\\'s a serious problem, Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism, You see, , third world countries are rich places, abundant in resources, , and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials, But plutocracies, in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and , traditionally oppressive European states, , , force the third world into buying overpriced, unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources, I\\'m quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words, My revolution is born out of love for my people, not hatred for others, You see, most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America, Aside from that, many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States, Places like El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Republica Dominicana, and not just Spanish-speaking countries either, but Haiti and Jamaica as well, As different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society, we are in the same struggle and until we realize that, we\\'ll be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self-determined, And that\\'s why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba, , or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques, But you see, here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people, \"Fuck them, let them fend for themselves.\" No, fuck you, they are you, No matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in, or follow an anorexic standard of beauty, or no matter , how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them, , no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on, you will never be them, They\\'re always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey. I\\'d rather be proud of what I am, rather than desperately trying to be something I\\'m really not, just to fit in, And whether we want to accept it or not, that\\'s what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us, I want a better life for my family and for my children, but it doesn\\'t have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland. We\\'re given the idea that if we didn\\'t have these people to exploit then America wouldn\\'t be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living, No, that\\'s wrong. , It\\'s the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money, We have whatever they kick down to us, My enemy is not the average white man, it\\'s not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street; my enemy is the white man I don\\'t see: the people in the white house, the corporate monopoly owners, fake liberal politicians those are my enemies, The generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real motherfuckers that I need to bring it to, Not the poor, broke country-ass soldier that\\'s too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up, In fact, I have more in common with most working- and middle-class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people, As much as racism bleeds America, we need to understand that classism is the real issue, ., Many of us are in the same boat and it\\'s sinking, while these bougie motherfuckers ride on a luxury liner, and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat we\\'re all in, we\\'re gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole, In other words, I don\\'t want to escape the plantation, I want to come back, free all my people, hang the motherfucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground, I want to take over the encomienda and give it back to the people who work the land, You cannot change the past but you can make the future, and anyone who tells you different is a fucking lethargic devil, I don\\'t look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole, Most of those successful individuals are sellouts and house negroes, But, I don\\'t consider brothers a sell-out if they move out of the ghetto, Poverty has nothing to do with our people. It\\'s not in our culture to be poor, That\\'s only been the last 500 years of our history; look at the last 2000 years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science, mathematics, agriculture, and forms of government, You know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states? The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois League, The idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition. That\\'s why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people cause he represented the agenda of White Spaniards once he was captured, Not the Aztec people who would become Mexicans, So in conclusion, I\\'m not gonna vote for anybody just cause they Black or Latino. They have to truly represent the community and represent what\\'s good for all of us proletariat, Porque sino entonces te mando por el carajo cabron gusano hijo de puta, seramos libre pronto, viva la revolucion, VIVA LA REVOLUCION, 10, Embed', 'Industrial Revolution Lyrics, [Intro], The day of the geechee is gone boy, And you goin\\' with it, Yeah, nigga, Immortal Technique, Metaphysics, [Verse 1], The bling-bling era was cute but it\\'s about to be done, I leave you full of clips like the Moon blocking the Sun, My metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch, Like an escape tunnel in prison, I started from scratch, And now these parasites want a percent of my ASCAP, Trying to control perspective like an acid flashback, But here\\'s a quotable for every single record exec, \"Get your fucking hands out my pocket, nigga!\" like Malcolm X, But this ain’t a movie, I\\'m not a fan or a groupie and I\\'m not, The type of cat you can afford to miss if you shoot me, Curse the Heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me, Immortal Technique stuck in your thoughts, , darkening dreams, No one\\'s as good as me—they just got better marketing schemes, I\\'ll lead you to your own destruction like sparking a fiend, \\'Cause you got jealousy in your voice like Starscream, And that\\'s the primary reason that I hate y\\'all faggots, I\\'ve been nice since niggas got killed over 8-ball jackets, And Reebok Pumps that didn\\'t do shit for the sneaker, I\\'m a heatseaker with features that\\'ll reach through the speaker, And murder counter-revolutionaries personally, Break a thermometer and force-feed his kids mercury, A&R\\'s tried jerking me, thinking they call shots, Offered me a deal and a blanket full of smallpox, You\\'re all getting shot, you little fucking treacherous bitches!, [Hook], This is the business, and y\\'all ain’t getting nothing for free, And if you devils play broke, then I\\'m taking your company, You could call it reparations or restitution, Lock and load, nigga.

Reach for your glasses, I\\'ll burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards, Innocent deep in a casket—Colombian fashion, Intoxicated off the flow like thug\\'s passion, You motherfuckers will never get me to stop blasting, You\\'re better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion, You\\'re better off begging for twenty points from a label, You\\'re better off battling cancer under telephone cables, Technique chemically unstable, set to explode, Foretold by the dead sea scrolls written in code, So if your message ain’t shit, fuck the records you sold!, \\'Cause if you go platinum, it\\'s got nothing to do with luck, It just means that a million people are stupid as fuck, Stuck in the underground, a general that rose to the limit, Without distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick, Revolutionary Volume 2,  murder the critics, And leave your fucking body rotting for the roaches and crickets, [Hook], This is the business, and y\\'all ain’t getting nothing for free, And if you devils play broke, then I\\'m taking your company, You could call it reparations or restitution, Lock and load, nigga.
